# bank-churn-prediction
## Project Overview
<p>This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict bank customer churn. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company or bank. By identifying potential churners in advance, banks can take proactive measures to retain valuable customers and minimize revenue loss. This repository provides a comprehensive solution for predicting customer churn using various machine learning algorithms.</p>

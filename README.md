# BANK-ATTRITION-PREDICION
## Project Overview
<p>This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict bank customer churn. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company or bank. By identifying potential churners in advance, banks can take proactive measures to retain valuable customers and minimize revenue loss. This repository provides a comprehensive solution for predicting customer churn using various machine learning algorithms.</p>

<h3>Steps Followed</h3>
<strong>1. Data collection:</strong> Obtained the customer churn dataset from Source Dataset Link.<br><br>
<strong>2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): </strong> Performed the comprehensive exploratory analysis to gain insights into the dataset, identify patterns, correlations, and potential predictive features.<br><br>
<strong>3. Data Preprocessing:</strong>Cleansed the data, handled categorical values, normalized the data, and addressed imbalanced data.<br><br>
<strong>4. Model Development:</strong>Assessed the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score. Selected the best-performing model for deploymet.<br><br>
<strong>5. Model Evaluation:</strong>Assessed the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score. Selected the best-performing model.<br><br>
<h2>Results and Evaluation Criterion</h2>
<p>Based on the evaluation results, the best-performing model was XGBoost which achieved an accuracy of 96% and F1-score of 89%</p>
